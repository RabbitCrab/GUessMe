# Intelligent-Clothes-Hanger

The hanger will shape out by the galvanised wire and the hanger will turn using stepper motor according to the data of the light sensitivity, for instance, to detect whichever the side that has higher sensitivity and making the hanger to turn over to that side. Then the GPS is used to find the location of the hanger and buzzer to sound on. Next, the reed switch is to attach on the hook of the hanger when it is placed on the rod of the hanger rack, then the time is recorded. The user can track through the time using phone apps.
